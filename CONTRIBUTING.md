# ðŸ§ª Test Policy

All major changes to KEYREAPER_2133.R4 **must** include appropriate unit or functional tests under the `/test/` directory.

Contributors are expected to:

- Add a test case for each new core function or fix
- Ensure tests pass before submission (`pio test` or Arduino serial output)
- Include test output logs in the pull request, or paste screenshots if run via Serial Monitor

Exceptions (e.g., hardware-tied features) must be noted clearly in the PR description.
